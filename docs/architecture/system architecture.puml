== Risk Assessment Phase ==
Admin -> UI : Configure monitoring area
UI -> Backend : Send area coordinates
Backend -> GISAPI : Request spatial data
GISAPI -> GISDB : Fetch elevation & location data
GISAPI -> ClimateDB : Fetch rainfall data
GISAPI -> HistoryDB : Fetch historical flood data
GISAPI --> Backend : Return combined GIS data

Backend -> AI : Analyze flood risk
AI -> AI : Calculate risk score
AI --> Backend : Return risk level

== Alert Generation Phase ==
Backend -> AlertSvc : Generate alert
AlertSvc -> UI : Push alert notification

== User Awareness Phase ==
User -> UI : View alert
User -> UI : Open education portal
UI -> Backend : Request safety guidance
Backend -> EduDB : Fetch relevant content
EduDB --> Backend : Return guidance
Backend --> UI : Display safety instructions
